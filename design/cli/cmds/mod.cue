		# hof mod - a golang MVS system for anything

		`hof mod` is a flexible tool and library based on Go mods.

		Use and create module systems with [Minimum Version Selection](https://research.swtch.com/vgo-mvs) semantics
		and manage dependencies `go mod` style.
		Mix any set of language, code bases, git repositories, package managers, and subdirectories.
		Manage polyglot and monorepo codebase dependencies with
		[100% reproducible builds](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#version-selection) from a single tool.


		### Features

		- Based on go mods MVS system, aiming for 100% reproducible builds.
		- Recursive dependencies, version resolution, and code instrospection.
		- Custom module systems with custom file names and vendor directories.
		- Control configuration for naming, vendoring, and other behaviors.
		- Polyglot support for multiple module systems and multiple languages within one tool.
		- Works with any git system and supports the main features from go mods.
		- Convert other vendor and module systems to MVS or just manage their files with MVS.

		Language support:

		- [golang](https://golang.org) - delegates to the go tool for the commands mirrored here
		- [cuelang](https://cuelang.org) - builtin in default using the custom module feature
		- [hofmods](https://hofstadter.io) - extends Cue with advanced code generation capabilities
		- [custom](./docs/custom-modders.md) - Create your own locally or globally with `.mvsconfig` files

		Upcoming languages: Python and JavaScript
		so they can have an MVS system and the benefits,
		and `hof mod` can start supporting and fetching from package registries.
		These language implementations will have flexibility to
		manage with `hof mod` and the common toolchain to varying degrees.
		Pull requests for improved language support are welcome.

		The main difference from go mods is that `hof mod`, generally,
		is not introspecting your code to determine dependencies.
		It relies on user management of the `<lang>.mods` file.
		Since golang is exec'd out to, introspection is supported,
		and as more languages improve, we look to similarly
		improve this situation in `hof mod`.
		A midstep to full custom implementation will be a
		introspection custom module with some basic support
		using file globs and regex lists.

		_Note, we also default to the plural `<lang>.mods/sums` files and `<lang.mod>/` vendor directory.
		This is 1) because cuelang reads from `cue.mod` directory, and 2) because it is less likely
		to collide with existing directories.
		You can also configure more behavior per language and module than go mods.
		The go mods is shelled out to as a convience, and often languages impose restrictions._


		### Usage

		```shell
		# Print known languages in the current directory
		hof mod info

		# Initialize this folder as a module
		hof mod init <lang> <module-path>

		# Add your requirements
		vim <lang>.mods  # go.mod like file

		# Pull in dependencies, no args discovers by *.mods and runs all
		hof mod vendor [langs...]

		# See all of the commands
		hof mod help
		```


		### Module File

		The module file holds the requirements for project.
		It has the same format as a `go.mod` file.

		```
		# These are like golang import paths
		#   i.e. github.com/hofstadter-io/hof
		module <module-path>

		# Information about the module type / version
		#  some systems that take this into account
		# go = 1.14
		<lang> = <version>

		# Required dependencies section
		require (
			# <module-path> <module-semver>
			github.com/hof-lang/cuemod--cli-golang v0.0.0      # This is latest on HEAD
			github.com/hof-lang/cuemod--cli-golang v0.1.5      # This is a tag v0.1.5 (can omit 'v' in tag, but not here)
			gitlab.com/namespace/project v1.1.0                # This need to be replaced to add the .git suffix
		)

		# replace <module-path> => <module-path|local-path> [version]
		replace github.com/hof-lang/cuemod--cli-golang => github.com/hofstadter-io/hofmod-cli-golang v0.2.0
		replace github.com/hof-lang/cuemod--cli-golang => ../../cuelibs/cuemod--cli-golang
        # manage namespaced projects
		replace gitlab.com/namespace/project => gitlab.com/namespace/project.git v1.1.0
		```

        ### Private Modules

        Private modules are managed in a similar way it's done for Go.
        Use the dedicated `<lang>PRIVATE` (`CUEPRIVATE`, `GOPRIVATE`) env var to indicate private modules.
        Set a comma-separated list of glob patterns (in the syntax of Go's path.Match) of module path prefixes that should always be fetched directly.

        See [go private modules](https://golang.org/ref/mod#private-modules).

		### Custom Module Systems

		`.mvsconfig.cue` allows you to define custom module systems.
		With some simple configuration, you can create and control
		and vendored module system based on `go mods`.
		You can also define global configurations.

		See the [custom-modder docs](./docs/custom-modders.md)
		to learn more about writing
		you own module systems.

		This is the current Cue __modder__ configuration:

		```cue
		cue: {
			Name: "cue"
			Version: "0.1.1"
			ModFile: "cue.mods"
			SumFile: "cue.sums"
			ModsDir: "cue.mod/pkg"
			MappingFile: "cue.mod/modules.txt"
			InitTemplates: {
				"cue.mod/module.cue": """
					module "{{ .Module }}"
					"""
				}

			VendorIncludeGlobs: []
			VendorExcludeGlobs: [
				"/.git/**",
				"**/cue.mod/pkg/**",
			]
		}
		```

		### Motivation

		- MVS has better semantics for vendoring and gets us closer to 100% reproducible builds.
		- JS and Python can have MVS while still using the remainder of the tool chains.
		- Prototype for cuelang module and vendor management.
		- We need a module system for our [hof-lang](https://hof-lang.org) project.

		We use this to generate the CLI code and files for CI.

		"overview": ##"""
		hof mods enable you to manage dependencies and versions for just about anything.

		You can run `hof mod <op> <lang> ...` for language specific operations or use
		just `hof mod <op>` to auto-discover module systems and run the operation on each.

		Modules do not have to be tied to a language, they can be arbitrary git repos.
		You have a lot of control for which files to include/exclude as well as
		life-cycle operations for performing any tasks around your modules.

		"""##

	"mod-file": ##"""
		The mod file is the same format as Golang mod files. The only difference is that
		the "Go = 1.14" is replaced with "<lang/mod> = <major>.<minor>"

		"""##

	"go": ##"""
		hof mod for Golang uses the Go tool behind the scenes.

		"""##

	"cue": ##"""
		hof mod for Cuelang is a prototype until module and dependency management is in the Cue tool.

		The version here is quite robust, however it lacks the code introspection like Golang,
		so you are required to manage your own cue.mods file.

		"""##

	"js": ##"""
		Not supported yet, but the idea is to use Go's MVS system on JS and other languages.

		"""##

	"py": ##"""
		Not supported yet, but the idea is to use Go's MVS system on Python and other languages.

		"""##

	"custom": ##"""
		hof mod allows you to create custom module systems and have MVS dependency management out of the box.

		### Create a Cue module:

		```
		hof mod init cue github.com/hofstadter-io/my-cue-mod

		### Vendor dependencies

		hof mod vendor cue

		You can use replaces to work on code locally

		# Custom Modules and Dependency Systems

		hod mod gives you the ability to create
		custom module systems, called Modders.
		Modder is the struct name for the
		internal code which controls how
		modules and vendoring is handled.
		You can configure as many of these as you like,
		by providing global or local `.mvsconfig.cue` files.

		You create your own modders by createing `.mvsconfig.cue` files.
		hog mod will look for these in two places before any commands are run.

		- A global `$HOME/.mvs/config.cue`
		- A local `./.mvsconfig.cue`
